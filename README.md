**Fast Json Normalize**

A package designed to be a drop in replacement for the pandas json normalize function, as it can be rather slow when dealing with very large json files.

It can be installed using

```
pip install fast-json-normalize
```

(plan on making a pull request once I've integrated it into a fork of [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
